abstract = {Essential Advanced Physics is a series comprising four parts:
          Classical Mechanics, Classical Electrodynamics,
          Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics. Each part
        consists of two volumes, Lecture Notes and Problems with
          Solutions, further supplemented by an additional collection of test problems and
        solutions available to qualifying university instructors. This volume, Statistical
          Mechanics: Problems with solutions contains detailed model solutions to the
        exercise problems formulated in the companion Lecture Notes volume. In many
        cases, the solutions include result discussions that enhance the lecture material. For
        reader’s convenience, the problem assignments are reproduced in this volume.},
